### Structure

- **docs:** The latest generated documentation for the Github Pages preview
- **files:** all relevant generation files

**Note:** The generation process is currently changing from solely json-based sources to more intuitive **markdown based** files to allow easier contributions by the public.

The markup format is described in [files/markup/README.md](files/markdown/README.md). Ultimatively the markup files will be converted into the intermediate JSON format which is used by the existing generator like before.

The generator and the JSON format are documented in [files/json/README.md](files/json/README.md).

### For Contributors:
