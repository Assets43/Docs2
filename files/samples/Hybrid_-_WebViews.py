There is an error in the code provided. The line `cfg.Hybrid` is not a valid statement in Python. The `cfg` variable is not defined in the code provided, so it's unclear what its purpose is. The code can be modified to remove the `cfg.Hybrid` line and adjust the code accordingly. Here's the modified code:

```python
from native import ui

# Called when application starts.
def OnStart():
    # Add main layout and set default child margins.
    layMain = ui.addLayout("main", "linear", "fillxy")
    layMain.setChildMargins(0.02, 0.01, 0.02, 0.01)

    # Add webview.
    web = ui.addWebView(layMain, "https://droidscript.org", "", 0.95, 0.9)

    # Add a navigation button.
    btnNavigate = ui.addButton(layMain, "Load News", "primary")
    btnNavigate.setOnTouch(lambda: web.loadUrl("https://droidscript.org/news-2"))
```
