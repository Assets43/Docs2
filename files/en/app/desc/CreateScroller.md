If you have much data to display which doesn't fit in the area availabe, you probably want to use a **Scroller**. The options for the Scroller are the same as the LinearLayout fill options, which set how a Scroller sizes within it's parent:- “FillX”, “FillY” and “FillXY”. By default Scrollers will auto-size to wrap their contents.

To add other controls to your scroller you need to put them in a scroller [layout](CreateLayout.htm) first, which you can then add to the scroller object.
