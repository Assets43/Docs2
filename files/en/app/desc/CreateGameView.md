The GameView is a blindingly fast container for game development with a physics engine and PIXI as underlying sprite container which uses the GPU to render graphics. The GameView runs a standalone script which can communicate with the main app via gfx.Execute or gmv.Execute vice versa.

Starting from DS 2.05 the GameView supports the same options as @CreateGame.
